  detailedDescription:
    "Online UPS systems deliver uncompromising power protection for Saudi Arabia’s most critical operations, using double-conversion technology to eliminate all grid irregularities. By continuously converting AC power to DC and back to AC, these systems provide pristine, stable electricity—ideal for safeguarding data centers in Riyadh’s tech parks, ICU equipment in Jeddah’s hospitals, and automated production lines in Eastern Province industrial zones. Designed for Saudi Arabia’s demanding climate, they excel in environments with frequent voltage sags, surges, or total outages, ensuring zero transfer time during disruptions. With their robust design, these UPS units are engineered to withstand desert heat, coastal humidity, and sandstorm-induced power quality issues while supporting Saudi Vision 2030’s infrastructure modernization goals.",

  maintenanceInfo:
    "Modular UPS systems require regular preventive maintenance to ensure optimal performance and longevity. This includes visual inspections, environmental checks, electrical measurements, battery testing, firmware updates, and functional tests. The recommended maintenance schedule is quarterly visual inspections, semi-annual preventive maintenance, and annual comprehensive service. The modular design allows for most maintenance activities to be performed without taking the system offline, significantly reducing the risk of downtime.",
  installationRequirements: [
    "Adequate floor loading capacity to support the UPS weight",
    "Proper ventilation and cooling to maintain operating temperature between 0-40°C",
    "Minimum clearance of 1m at front and rear for service access",
    "Appropriate electrical infrastructure including input/output distribution panels",
    "Network connectivity for remote monitoring (optional but recommended)",
    "Separate battery room for extended runtime configurations",
    "Fire suppression systems appropriate for electrical equipment",
  ],
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What is the difference between N+1 and 2N redundancy?",
      answer:
        "N+1 redundancy means having one more module than needed to support the load, so if one module fails, the system continues to operate. 2N redundancy means having double the required capacity, essentially two complete systems, providing the highest level of protection but at a higher cost.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I mix different capacity modules in the same system?",
      answer:
        "Most modular UPS systems require modules of the same capacity within a single frame. However, some advanced systems allow for mixed module sizes, though this may affect load balancing and redundancy calculations.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the expected lifespan of a modular UPS system?",
      answer:
        "The frame and power distribution components typically last 15-20 years, while individual power modules have a design life of 10-15 years. Batteries typically need replacement every 3-5 years for VRLA or 8-10 years for Li-ion.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can modular UPS systems work with generators?",
      answer:
        "Yes, modular UPS systems are designed to work with generators. They typically include programmable settings to adjust input parameters for generator compatibility, such as input frequency range and slew rate tolerance.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How does a modular UPS compare to a traditional UPS in terms of efficiency?",
      answer:
        "Modern modular UPS systems often have higher efficiency than traditional UPS systems, especially at partial loads. This is because modules can be switched on/off based on load requirements, allowing the system to operate in the optimal efficiency range.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the advantages of renting vs. buying a UPS system?",
      answer:
        "Renting is ideal for temporary needs, avoiding capital expenditure, and when you need flexibility. It includes maintenance and technical support. Buying is better for long-term needs, customization requirements, and when you want to build equity in the equipment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is included in the rental package?",
      answer:
        "Our rental packages typically include the UPS system, batteries for the specified runtime, installation and commissioning, 24/7 technical support, preventive maintenance during the rental period, and decommissioning at the end of the rental term.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upgrade my rental UPS if my power requirements change?",
      answer:
        "Yes, one of the advantages of our rental program is flexibility. If your power requirements increase during the rental period, we can upgrade your UPS system with minimal disruption to your operations.",
